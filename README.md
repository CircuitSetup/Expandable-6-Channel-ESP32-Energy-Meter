# CircuitSetup Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter can read 6 current channels and 2 voltage channels at a time. Much like our [Split Single Phase Energy Meter](https://circuitsetup.us/index.php/product/split-single-phase-real-time-whole-house-energy-meter-v1-4/), the 6 channel uses current transformers and an AC transformer to measure voltage and power the board(s)/ESP32\. The main board includes a buck converter to power the electronics and ESP32 dev board, which plugs directly into the board. Up to 6 add-on boards can stack on top of the main board to allow you to monitor **up to 42 current channels** in 16-bit resolution, in real time, all at once! This product is currently in the prototype stage, so components may change.

#### **Usage:**

* North American split single phase 120V/240V 60Hz - mains and/or individual circuits
* European single phase 240V 50Hz (must provide [AC-AC transformer](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/electricity-monitoring/voltage-sensing/different-acac-power-adapters) 9V or 12V with at least 500mA output)
* 3 phase - It is recommended to measure all 3 voltages with 3 voltage transformers. This can be done by using a main board with 1 add-on board (more information below). A single meter can be used to measure 3-phase, but power (wattage) will not be calculated correctly. Power can be calculated in software, but the [power factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor) will have to be estimated ((voltage*current)*power_factor)).

### **Setting up the Meter**

![Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircuitSetup/Expandable-6-Channel-ESP32-Energy-Meter/master/Images/6-channel_diagram.png)
![Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter Back Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircuitSetup/Expandable-6-Channel-ESP32-Energy-Meter/master/Images/6_channel_v1.4_back.png)

#### **Plugging in the ESP32**
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter is made so that an ESP32 dev board can be plugged directly into the meter. See the list above for compatible ESP32 dev boards. 
**Always insert the ESP32 with the 3V3 pin in the upper left of the meter**. The bottom pins are used to connect the voltage signal (from the power plug) to add-on boards. If the ESP32 is inserted into the bottom pins it will more than likely short the ESP32.

#### **Communicating with the ESP32**
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter uses SPI to communicate with the ESP32. Each board uses 2 CS pins. 

The **main board** uses the following SPI pins:
* CLK - 18
* MISO - 19
* MOSI - 23
* CS1 - 5 (CT1-CT3 & Voltage 1)
* CS2 - 4 (CT4-CT6 & Voltage 2)

The version of [EmonESP available here](https://github.com/CircuitSetup/Expandable-6-Channel-ESP32-Energy-Meter/tree/master/Software/EmonESP) has all of these pins set by default. 

For examples of how to set up your config in ESPHome, [see here](https://github.com/CircuitSetup/Expandable-6-Channel-ESP32-Energy-Meter/tree/master/Software/ESPHome) and [here.](https://next.esphome.io/components/sensor/atm90e32.html)

#### **Add-on Boards**
Add-on boards (up to 6) can expand the main energy meter up to 42 current channels & 8 voltage channels. The add-on boards plug directly into the main board as seen here.

The **add-on board** allows the CS pin to be selected based on the jumper settings at the bottom of the board. This is so multiple add-on boards can be used - up to 6 maximum. Do NOT select more than one CS pin per bank. 
The CS pins can be:
  * CT1-CT3 (CS):
    * For v1.3 and under:
      * 0
      * 2 (*make sure that an on board LED is not used for IO2 on the ESP32) 
      * 12 (*will cause ESP32 to not boot if used)
      * 13
      * 14
      * 15
    * For v1.4 and above:
      * 0
      * 27
      * 35 (do not use - it will not work correctly)
      * 13
      * 14
      * 15
    * For v1.4 rev1 and above:
      * 35 is changed to 2 (may prevent the ESP32 from being programmed - disconnect jumper if so)
  * CT4-CT6 (CS2):
    * 16
    * 17
    * 21
    * 22
    * 25
    * 26

         * v1.2: 42620
         
#### **Measuring Power & Other Metering Values**
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter uses 2 ATM90E32AS ICs. Each IC has 3 voltage channels and 3 current channels. In order for power metering data to be calculated internally, each current channel must have a reference voltage. If the voltage is out of phase with the current, then the current and power will read as negative, affecting the power factor and power calculations. If you have a split single phase or dual phase setup, the solution is to turn around the current transformer on the wire.

v1.1 of the meter used 1 of the voltage channels for each IC. This means that power and metering data would have to be calculated in software, or voltage channels would have to be mapped via changing registers on the IC to get power and metering data from CT2, CT3, CT5, CT6. 

v1.2 & v1.3 have JP8-JP11 on the back of the board, that would allow all voltage channels to be connected together, which would allow power and other metering values to be calculated. Most of v1.3 came soldered together.

v1.4 removed JP8-JP11, and has voltage channels connected internally on the pcb. 

#### **Measuring Dual Pole (240V) Circuits**
For split single phase applications, dual pole circuits have 2 hot wires that total 240V (usually red and black in newer buildings). In most cases both poles are used equally, but in others there may be electronics in the applicance that use only 1 pole. 
There are 3 different options for measuring these circuits:
- Monitor 1 phase with 1 CT, and double the current output in software (least accurate) See details on how to do this in [ESPHome here](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/index.html#offset-multiply).
- Use 2 CTs to monitor each hot wire on the circuit (if you are monitoring 1 voltage, they should be in opposite directions from eachother)
- If you have enough wire, and the CT is large enough, run both hot wires through 1 CT in opposite directions

#### **Measuring A Second Voltage**
The holes labelled VA2 next to the power plug on the meter main board, and in the bottom right of the add-on board are for measuring a second voltage. To do this you must:
* Sever (with a knife) JP12 and JP13 on the back of the board for v1.3+, or JP7 for prior versions
* Use a second AC transformer, ideally one identical to the primary
* Plug in the second AC transformer to an outlet on the opposite phase to the primary
* Solder on a pin header, 3.5mm (2.54mm for v1.3 and earlier) screw connector, or DC style jack pigtail on to VA2+ & VA2- (next to the main power/voltage jack)

When voltage jumpers are severed, the voltage reference for CT4-CT6 will be from VA2. This means that current transformers for CT4-CT6 should be hooked up to circuits that are on the same phase as VA2, and CT1-CT3 should be hooked up to circuits that are in phase with the primary voltage. If a CT is not in phase with the voltage its current and power readings will be negative. If, for example, you have 4 circuits in phase with the primary, and 2 in phase with VA2, you can reverse the current transformer on the wire to put it in phase with the voltage (assuming split single phase or dual phase)

For add-on boards, the primary voltage will come from the main board. The optional secondary voltage measurement (also VA2 pins), will be in phase with CT4-CT6.

#### **Measuring 3-Phase Electricity**
What you'll need to measure all 3 phases properly: 
* 6 Channel Main Board (v1.4 and above)
* 6 Channel Add-on Board
* 3 voltage transformers - one for each phase. These can either be wall, plug-in type (if you have an outlet wired to each phase), or stand-alone transformers wired directly to breakers. They must bring down the voltage to between 9-14VAC. The first one that plugs into the main board also powers the ESP32 and electronics, so it must output at least 500mA.
* Headers soldered to the VA2 terminals on the main board and add-on board
* JP12 and JP13 severed on both boards

Similar to the above for measuring a second voltage, once JP12 and JP13 are severed, CT1-CT3 on the main board, and CT1-CT3 on the add-on board will be in phase with the 1st phase, CT3-CT4 on the main board with the 2nd phase, and CT3-CT4 on the add-on board with the 3rd phase. The transformers should be calibrated individually for greater accuracy.

Alternately, you can use two add-on boards and assign one phase to each board. To do this, instead of severing JP12 and JP13, you cut both front-most pins (i.e. those which the ESP32 does *not* plug into) of the extension boards' connectors. Then connect each phase to one of the connectors.

On 3-phase systems, a current meter that's connected to the wrong phase will always result in near-zero active power.

### **Setting Up Software**
#### **EmonESP/EmonCMS**
EmonESP is used to send energy meter data to a [local install of EmonCMS](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms), or [emoncms.org](https://emoncms.org/). Data can also be sent to a MQTT broker through this. EmonCMS has Android and IOS apps.
[The ESP32 sofware for EmonESP is located here](/CircuitSetup/Expandable-6-Channel-ESP32-Energy-Meter/tree/master/Software/EmonESP), and can be flash to an ESP32 using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). See [details on setup here.](https://github.com/CircuitSetup/Split-Single-Phase-Energy-Meter/tree/master/Software/EmonESP)

#### **ESPHome/Home Assistant**
[ESPHome](https://esphome.io) can be loaded on an ESP32 to seamlessly integrate energy data into [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Energy data can then be saved in InfluxDB and displayed with Grafana. At the same time, the energy data can also be used for automations in Home Assistant.
