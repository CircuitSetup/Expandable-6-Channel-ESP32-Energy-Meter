# CircuitSetup Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter can read 6 current channels and 2 voltage channels at a time. Much like our [Split Single Phase Energy Meter](https://circuitsetup.us/index.php/product/split-single-phase-real-time-whole-house-energy-meter-v1-4/), the 6 channel uses current transformers and an AC transformer to measure voltage and power the board(s)/ESP32\. The main board includes a buck converter to power the electronics and ESP32 dev board, which plugs directly into the board. Up to 6 add-on boards can stack on top of the main board to allow you to monitor **up to 42 current channels** in 16-bit resolution, in real time, all at once! This product is currently in the prototype stage, so components may change.

### **Setting up the Meter**

#### **Plugging in the ESP32**
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter is made so that an ESP32 dev board can be plugged directly into the meter. See the list above for compatible ESP32 dev boards. 
**Always insert the ESP32 with the 3V3 pin in the upper left of the meter**. The bottom pins are used to connect the voltage signal (from the power plug) to add-on boards. If the ESP32 is inserted into the bottom pins it will more than likely short the ESP32.

#### **Communicating with the ESP32**
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter uses SPI to communicate with the ESP32. Each board uses 2 CS pins. 

The **main board** uses the following SPI pins:
* CLK - 18
* MISO - 19
* MOSI - 23
* CS1 - 5 (CT1-CT3 & Voltage 1)
* CS2 - 4 (CT4-CT6 & Voltage 2)

The **add-on board** allows the CS pin to be selected based on the jumper settings at the bottom of the board. This is so multiple add-on boards can be used - up to 6 maximum. Do NOT select more than one CS pin per bank. 
The CS pins can be:
  * CT1-CT3 (CS):
    * For v1.3 and under:
      * 0
      * 2 (*make sure that an on board LED is not used for IO2 on the ESP32) 
      * 12 (*will cause ESP32 to not boot if used)
      * 13
      * 14
      * 15
    * For v1.4 and above:
      * 0
      * 27
      * 35 (do not use - it will not work correctly)
      * 13
      * 14
      * 15
    * For v1.4 rev1 and above:
      * 35 is changed to 2 (may prevent the ESP32 from being programmed - disconnect jumper if so)
  * CT4-CT6 (CS2):
    * 16
    * 17
    * 21
    * 22
    * 25
    * 26

        * v1.2: 42620

#### **Measuring Power & Other Metering Values**
The Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter uses 2 ATM90E32AS ICs. Each IC has 3 voltage channels and 3 current channels. In order for power metering data to be calculated internally, each current channel must have a reference voltage. If the voltage is out of phase with the current, then the current and power will read as negative. 

v1.1 of the meter used 1 of the voltage channels for each IC. This means that power and metering data would have to be calculated in software, or voltage channels would have to be mapped via changing registers on the IC to get power and metering data from CT2, CT3, CT5, CT6. 

v1.2 & v1.3 have JP8-JP11 on the back of the board, that would allow all voltage channels to be connected together, which would allow power and other metering values to be calculated. Most of v1.3 came soldered together.

v1.4 removed JP8-JP11, and has voltage channels connected internally on the pcb. 

#### **Measuring A Second Voltage**
The holes labelled VA2 next to the power plug on the meter main board, and in the bottom right of the add-on board are for measuring a second voltage. To do this you must:
* Sever (with a knife) JP12 and JP13 on the back of the board for v1.3+, or JP7 for prior versions
* Use a second AC transformer, ideally one identical to the primary
* Plug in the second AC transformer to an outlet on the opposite phase to the primary
* Solder on a pin header, 2.54mm screw connector, or pigtail on to VA2+ & VA2-

When voltage jumpers are severed, the voltage reference for CT4-CT6 will be from VA2. This means that current transformers for CT4-CT6 should be hooked up to circuits that are on the same phase as VA2, and CT1-CT3 should be hooked up to circuits that are in phase with the primary voltage. If a CT is not in phase with the voltage its current and power readings will be negative. If, for example, you have 4 circuits in phase with the primary, and 2 in phase with VA2, you can reverse the current transformer on the wire to put it in phase with the voltage. 

For add-on boards, the primary voltage will come from the main board. The optional secondary voltage measurement (also VA2 pins), will be in phase with CT4-CT6.
